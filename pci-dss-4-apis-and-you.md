# PCI DSS 4, APIs, and You - The Ostrich is Looking Around

If you hadn't heard the news, the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Stanards Committee (SSC) Data Security Standards (DSS) have been updated and come into effect on March 31st, 2024. This is a major update that corrects some of the sins of the past and drives home the need to "shift left" with security and also regulates APIs by name. This is a huge difference from the previous PCI DSS standard of 3.2.1, over 50 between the two. In this post we are going to discuss broadly the changes, specifically in section 6 of PCI DSS 4.
