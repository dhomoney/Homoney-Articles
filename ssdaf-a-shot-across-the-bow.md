# The SSDAF - A Shot Across the AppSec Bow

Did you hear that? If you aren't paying attention to the Application Security world, and software in general, you can be excused for not hearing it, but let there be no doubt, the United States Federal government, under the guise of the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency of the Department of Homeland Security, did just that. On March 11th Anno Domini 2024, they released the Secure Software Development Attestation Form (SSDAF).

## Secure Software Development Attestation Form Instructions Summary

The document provided outlines the instructions for completing the Secure Software Development Attestation Form, a critical component of the cybersecurity framework implemented by the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). This framework is part of a broader initiative to secure the software supply chain within the Federal Government, in response to increasing cybersecurity threats. Here is a summary organized into key segments:

### Privacy Act Statement and Authority

- **Source of Authority**: The form's collection of information is authorized by 44 U.S.C. ยง 3554, Executive Order 14028 titled "Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity," and specific OMB Memorandums aimed at enhancing software supply chain security.
- **Purpose and Disclosure**: Designed to assure the Federal Government that software is developed securely, the information collected might be disclosed under certain conditions to protect national security and improve cybersecurity practices.

### Purpose of the Form

- **FISMA Requirements**: The form fulfills mandates from the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA), which requires securing both information and information systems used by Federal agencies.
- **E.O. 14028 and NIST Guidance**: It adheres to Executive Order 14028's directives and incorporates practices from the NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) and Software Supply Chain Security Guidance to ensure the development of secure software.

### Software Requiring Attestation

- **Criteria for Attestation**: Software developed or significantly updated after September 14, 2022, or continuously updated software products, must undergo self-attestation to verify secure development practices.
- **Exclusions**: The attestation does not apply to software developed by Federal agencies, directly obtained open-source software, third-party components incorporated into end products, or freely obtained and publicly available software.

### Attestation and Form Completion

- **Required Information**: Software producers must provide detailed information about their software and affirm adherence to secure development practices. This includes ensuring secure environments for software development, maintaining a trusted source code supply chain, ensuring the provenance of code and components, and employing tools to manage security vulnerabilities.
- **Attestation Process**: The form must be signed by a company's CEO or an authorized designee, attesting to compliance with secure software development practices outlined in the form. Alternatively, software producers can submit a third-party assessment from an approved assessor.

### Additional Provisions

- **Third-Party Components**: Software producers are responsible for attesting that they have taken steps to minimize risks associated with third-party components in their products.
- **Agency-Specific Instructions**: The form may be accompanied by agency-specific instructions or requirements, which could include additional documentation.

### Burden Statement

- **Estimated Completion Time**: Completing the form is estimated to take 3 hours and 20 minutes, with the requirement of displaying a valid OMB control number.

### Appendix and References

- **Mapping to SSDF Practices**: The appendix provides a detailed mapping between the attestation requirements and specific practices and tasks within the NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF).

This form represents a crucial effort by CISA and the Federal Government to ensure that software used within the government is developed according to the highest standards of cybersecurity, safeguarding against vulnerabilities that could compromise national security and the privacy of citizens.

## Conclusion

The SSDAF is a seachange that needed to happen. As the world changes and we continue down the paths of digital transformation and artificial intellegence it is obvious that we can no longer be so lacksidasical around software supply chain security and secure software development. This also further drives companys to "shift left" and no longer require SecOps to bear the burden of securing the applications along. Further, and for the first time really, CEOs heads are on the chopping block if their companies deliver insecure code, especially if it comes out in congressional hearings that there were obvious things that could have been done. Who wants to sit in that hot seat?
