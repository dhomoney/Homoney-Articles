# The SSDAF - A Shot Across the AppSec Bow

Did you hear that? If you aren't paying attention to the Application Security world, and software in general, you can be excused for not hearing it, but let there be no doubt, the United States Federal government, under the guise of the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency of the Department of Homeland Security, did just that. On March 11th Anno Domini 2024, they released the Secure Software Development Attestation Form (SSDAF).

## Key Highlights from the Form

- **Source of Authority**: The form's collection of information is authorized by 44 U.S.C. ยง 3554, Executive Order 14028 titled "Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity," and specific OMB Memorandums aimed at enhancing software supply chain security.
- **Purpose and Disclosure**: Designed to assure the Federal Government that software is developed securely, the information collected might be disclosed under certain conditions to protect national security and improve cybersecurity practices.
- **Criteria for Attestation**: Software developed or significantly updated after September 14, 2022, or continuously updated software products, must undergo self-attestation to verify secure development practices.

- **Exclusions**: The attestation does not apply to software developed by Federal agencies, directly obtained open-source software, third-party components incorporated into end products, or freely obtained and publicly available software.
- **Required Information**: Software producers must provide detailed information about their software and affirm adherence to secure development practices. This includes ensuring secure environments for software development, maintaining a trusted source code supply chain, ensuring the provenance of code and components, and employing tools to manage security vulnerabilities.
- **Attestation Process**: The form must be signed by a company's CEO or an authorized designee, attesting to compliance with secure software development practices outlined in the form. Alternatively, software producers can submit a third-party assessment from an approved assessor.
- **Third-Party Components**: Software producers are responsible for attesting that they have taken steps to minimize risks associated with third-party components in their products.

## Conclusion

The SSDAF is a seachange that needed to happen. As the world changes and we continue down the paths of digital transformation and artificial intellegence it is obvious that we can no longer be so lacksidasical around software supply chain security and secure software development. This also further drives companys to "shift left" and no longer require SecOps to bear the sole burden of securing the applications at runtime. Developers also need tools that don't provide so much noise and clutter that real issues get missed. Further, and for the first time really, the business and not just CIOs and CISOs, that bear the consequences if they deliver insecure code, especially if congressional hearings take place and there were obvious things that could have been done but weren't. Who wants to sit in that hot seat?
