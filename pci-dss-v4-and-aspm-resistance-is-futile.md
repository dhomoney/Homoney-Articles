![Assimilation](/images/aspm-assimilating-pcidss.jpg)

PCI DSS 4.0 ushers in a new era for AppSec teams, spotlighting the need for continuous, systematic, and forward-thinking approaches to application security. This blog explores how the revised PCI DSS 4.0 standards beckon new and tighter application security controls and how ASPM facilitates compliance with the new standards.

Nearly two decades on, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) continues to mold the landscape of secure software development, runtime security, and management for entities handling cardholder data. The advent of PCI DSS 4.0 heralds 64 fresh mandates and significant shifts from its predecessor, PCI DSS 3.2.1, marking a pivotal moment for organizations in the payment card ecosystem and SecOps in general.

At its core, PCI DSS 4.0 favors an ingrained culture of daily compliance over periodic assessments, underscoring a commitment to ceaseless, integrated, and anticipatory application security. This evolution profoundly influences application and product security frameworks whether regulated by PCI DSS or not. It is also helping to drive, much like API Security is, SecOps into paying attention to things other than infrastructure security, which has been their domain for so long. The old ostrich needs to pull its head out of the sand and PCI DSS v4 is forcing the issue. 

## PCI DSS 4.0's Impact on AppSec

Absent a holistic AppSec strategy fortified by synergistic tools for complete visibility and assessment, organizations now face a pressing mandate to evolve. PCI DSS 4.0 compels AppSec groups to sculpt comprehensive programs that ensure sustained security across all facets of application exposure, alongside robust resilience mechanisms for incident response.

Essential components for PCI DSS 4.0 compliance in the AppSec realm include:

- Explicitly defined roles, duties, and protocols for identifying, prioritizing, remedying, and thwarting security flaws.
- Extensive vulnerability identification and security coverage, now explicitly encompassing APIs.
- An up-to-date inventory of in-house, custom, and third-party software elements.
- Standardized, objective, and replicable procedures for managing security concerns, especially critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.
- Strategies for detecting and managing significant system alterations.
- Secrets management and remediation frameworks.
- Comprehensive vulnerability management extending beyond AppSec to include network and system-wide perspectives.
- Targeted secure coding training for developers, tailored to their specific roles, programming languages, and toolsets.
- Provision for evidence and confirmation of comprehension and completion of security mandates.

Given the resource constraints typical within AppSec teams and the stark ratio of developers to AppSec personnel, aligning with these demands necessitates a unified, concerted effort across teams, methodologies, and technologies.

This discourse delves into the pivotal updates within PCI DSS 4.0 affecting AppSec teams and elucidates how Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) serves as a cogent, automated framework for governance throughout the development lifecycle.

## Key PCI DSS 4.0 Updates for AppSec

The bulk of modifications impacting AppSec teams are encapsulated in the following requirements:

- **Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Software.** 
- **Identify Users and Authenticate Access to System Components** (8.6.2 introduces a new mandate against hard-coding passwords/passphrases within any scripts or files for application and system accounts enabling interactive login.)
- **Test the Security of Systems and Networks Regularly.**
- **Support Information Security with Organizational Policies and Programs.**

Requirement 6 stands out, emphasizing the necessity for secure software development practices, complete with security policy documentation, role definitions, and earlier vulnerability identification and mitigation in the development cycle, alongside comprehensive software inventories and contextual developer training.

Requirements 8, 11, and 12 underscore the importance of robust access controls, secret management, extensive testing (automated and penetration tests), and the operationalization of AppSec programs through annual risk assessments, security policy enforcement, developer training assignments, and more.

## Achieving PCI DSS 4.0 Compliance with ASPM

If you don't already know what ASPM is, it stands for Application Security Posture Management. ASPM is a new holistic approach designed to enhance and maintain the security stance of applications throughout their lifecycle. By integrating various tools and practices, ASPM provides a unified view of an application's security health, enabling organizations to detect, **prioritize**, and remediate vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in a data-driven, intelligent manner. This methodology extends beyond traditional application security measures by incorporating continuous monitoring, risk assessment, and governance practices to ensure that security is ingrained in every phase of the development process, from initial design to deployment and maintenance. ASPM empowers organizations to not only respond to immediate security threats but also to anticipate potential vulnerabilities, thereby strengthening their overall security framework and compliance posture in an ever-evolving threat landscape. The best of these integrate with runtime as we've discussed in my articles before. 

In an era where security stakes are ever-escalating (as illustrated by the repercussions faced by entities like Microsoft and Change Health), PCI DSS 4.0 challenges AppSec teams to elevate their strategies, often within the constraints of existing or reduced budgets. ASPM allows customers to focus on those strained resources and remediate the truly threatening vulnerabilities instead of them getting lost in a sea of false or unexploitable alerts.

### Prioritizing and Addressing Vulnerabilities

- **Code Review Enhancements:** Before deploying custom software into production, code reviews are mandated to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities, adhering to secure coding practices and scrutinizing both prevalent and emerging threats.
  
- **Engineering Techniques for Software Security:** Defined and employed techniques aim to curb common software threats and vulnerabilities in custom software, emphasizing preemptive action and mitigation.

A shift towards integrated security across the development lifecycle is palpable in PCI 4.0, advocating for a holistic risk management approach that encompasses proactive, automated responses to identified risks.

### Comprehensive Application and Software Supply Chain Inventory

- **Maintaining a Robust Software Inventory:** PCI 4.0 mandates the upkeep of a detailed inventory of custom software and third-party components, utilizing this repository to pinpoint and mitigate vulnerabilities efficiently. This applies to APIs as well as applications, something that until PCI DSS v4 wasn't called out. APIs are really modern applications. ASPM, especially in combination with runtime API Security allows for complete Application and API inventory without anything slipping through the cracks.

### Managing Significant Changes and Audits

- **System Change Management:**

 Establishing protocols for managing changes within the production environment, ensuring that such modifications do not detrimentally affect system security.

### Developer Training and Secure Coding

- **Focused Developer Training:** Mandating annual training for software development personnel on security practices relevant to their roles, aiming to embed secure design and coding techniques into the development process. This may be one of the biggest changes in PCI DSS v4 that doesn't nearly get the press it should. Mandated yearly training for developers in secure code development and on the tools being used to comply. Fantastic stuff that should be lauded from the mountain tops.

### Application Security Posture Management

To navigate the complexities of AppSec program operationalization, ASPM offers a streamlined avenue for setting policies, integrating developer guardrails, and conducting security coverage mapping. This holistic approach enables AppSec teams to maximize efficiency while ensuring adherence to evolving security standards with the least amount of friction being added to the developers' day-to-day lives, which is key to security tool adoption. 

ASPM's role in AppSec strategy encompasses an open platform ethos choosing to integrate with the tools DevOps already consume, merging native application security testing (AST) and software supply chain security solutions (SSCS) to offer a cohesive view of AppSec risks, prioritization, and remediation efforts. This integrated model not only simplifies governance across the development lifecycle but also empowers teams to address security challenges with greater agility and precision.
